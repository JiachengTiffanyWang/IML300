      <h2>Purpose and inspiration</h2>
<h1>I have been really passionate about how different beauty standards are formed in different cultures, and I am eager to express those emotions and attitudes that different beauty styles convey.Personally, I am always inspired by the emotions and enthusiasm embedded in different aesthetic styles. This website will be a mini-exhibition of my favorite artistic styles, and how I perceive each of their emotions and beauty. Growing up in multiple cultures, My goal is to express my cultural understanding of my favorite aesthetics and their historical connections. This website will predominantly use color as a tool to strike the audiences’ personal emotions, and the format of a free floating exhibition will lead the audience in feeling the beauty of the world from my eyes. The website will also exhibit my photography of things and ideas that I find beautiful in my daily life. Notions and poetry inspired by visual beauty will always be presented at this website. Under the current pandemic, fear occupies a large portion of our lives. I hope to spread the important value of seeking true beauty and light in a dark age.</h1>
